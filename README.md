# Resnet50

# Overview :
Resnet short for Residual Networks is a classic neural network used as a backbone for many computer vision tasks and '50' refers to 50 layers of neurons. This model was the winner of ImageNet challenge in 2015. The fundamental breakthrough with ResNet was it allowed us to train extremely deep neural networks with 150+layers successfully. Prior to ResNet training very deep neural networks was difficult due to the problem of vanishing gradients.
